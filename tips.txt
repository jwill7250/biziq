RESOURCES > Graphics > Social Icons and Code > Renamed for Footer -- this is where all the icons to replace the crappy generic footer icons are.

To do this in wordpress go to to Widget Settings (towards the bottom of the left sidebar) and in the upload section at the bottom drop in all the images of the cred builders you plan on using (props to Billy).

The jquery needed to get rid of empty p tags goes in the footer.php inside the script tags after the code: "jQuery(document).ready( function($) { "

$('p').each(function() {
    var $this = $(this);
    if($this.html().replace(/\s|&nbsp;/g, '').length == 0)
$this.remove();
});
// To leave the &nbsp; in the page just remove that from inside the replace parentheses.

Drop this code into the bottom of your style sheet until next gamma update rolls out: 

@media only screen and (max-width: 767px) {
 		 nav.nav ul li:after {
 display: none !important;
  }
}

For all classes with parallax: set up a 767px media query with the style:

background-attachment: scroll;
